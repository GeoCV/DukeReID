# DukeMTMC4ReID
DukeMTMC4ReID dataset is new large-scale real-world person re-id dataset based on [DukeMTMC](http://vision.cs.duke.edu/DukeMTMC/). We use a fast state-of-the-art [person detector](https://bitbucket.org/rodrigob/doppia) for accurate detections. After verified by the ground truth, for each identity, we uniformly sample 5 "good" bounding boxes in each available camera, while retaining all the "FP" bounding boxes in the corresponding frames. To summarize, the relevant statistics of the proposed DukeMTMC4ReID dataset are provided below:
* Images corresponding to 1,852 people existing across all the 8 cameras
* 1,413 unique identities with 22,515 bounding boxes that appear in more than one camera (valid identities)
* 439 distractor identities with 2,195 bounding boxes that appear in only one camera, in addition to 21,551 ?FP? bounding boxes from the person detector
* The size of the bounding box varies from 72×34 pixels to 415×188 pixels
